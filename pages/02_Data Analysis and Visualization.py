# Data Analysis and Visualization
### Two key decisions at the beginning

As part of the data exploration phase, we made two key decisions:

- **Define two sets of target variables:**  
  A career-oriented target set and a role-specific target set.  
  This approach allowed us to keep the model simple and transparent,  
  while covering both general career paths and specific job roles.  
  In short, we moved from a broad question:  
  *‚ÄúWhat matters for a career path?‚Äù*  
  to a more focused one:  
  *‚ÄúWhat matters for a specific role in Data Science?‚Äù*.

- **Reduce the number of features:**  
  We deliberately limited the number of input variables.  
  This involved dropping many questionnaire answers (columns)  
  to avoid overfitting and to improve clarity and interpretability.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how we defined our target variables.

---

### Target Variables

The target variable is based on **Question 5**:  
*‚ÄúSelect the title most similar to your current role (or most recent title if retired).‚Äù*

#### Broad career role

This groups several roles into broader career paths:

- **Data Science**  
  Includes the following titles:  
  - Data Analyst  
  - Data Scientist  
  - Machine Learning Engineer  
  - Data Engineer  
  - Research Scientist

- **Tech**  
  Includes the following titles:  
  - Software Engineer  
  - DBA / Database Engineer

#### Specific career role

In contrast to the broad roles, this version focuses on selected job titles without aggregation.  
We only included roles that are widely known and clearly defined:

- Data Analyst  
- Data Scientist  
- Software Engineer

st.markdown("""### What do these values tell us regarding correlations?

The **p-value** tells us how likely it is to observe this relationship *by chance alone*, assuming there's no real connection.  
If the p-value is below **0.05**, it‚Äôs considered statistically significant ‚Äî  
in other words: it‚Äôs very unlikely this happened randomly.  
There‚Äôs probably some kind of meaningful relationship between the two variables.

**Cram√©r's V** goes one step further: it tells us *how strong* the relationship is.  
As a rule of thumb:

- **Weak association**: V ‚â§ 0.10  
- **Moderate association**: 0.10 < V ‚â§ 0.30  
- **Strong association**: V > 0.30  

In general, we can say: Yes, there is a correlartion between the answers and the roles. 
But it is weak when we consider each single answer. But what if we check for correlations of all answers in parallel? 
Or, in other words, **what if we apply a well selected Machine Learning algorithm for categorical features and targets?** 
You see, it‚Äôs getting a bit more technical now. We‚Äôre about to modelling!""")
